title: Metafy.it - a beginners try to build a Sinatra webapp

{{ page.title }}
================

[Metafy.it](http://www.metafy.it) is a website for searching and querying the [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com) meta API. The code can be found at [github](https://www.github.com/netfeed/metafy.it). I will go through the steps necessary to install the application. We will run it on Unicorn + Nginx inside a rvm environment. 

Most of this is basically rewrites/compilation of the the [Sinatra book](http://sinatra-book.gittr.com/#deployment_nginx) and the rvm documentation.

First install rvm, follow the instructions at [their](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) website, but basically it's just:

{% highlight bash %}
  bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )
  rvm install 1.9.2
{% endhighlight %}

There could be problems with the installation, such as missing zlib et al. See the [rvm packages page](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/packages/) on solutions to fix these kind of problems, this is quite straight forward. You might also miss some of the tools necessary to install the ruby versions, but "apt-get install build-essentials" should pretty much be enough if you're running Ubuntu

After that we'll fetch the code and add a [rvm project file](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/workflow/rvmrc/) to the directory so we only need to install the gems necessary for this installation.

{% highlight bash %}
  git clone git@github.com:netfeed/metafy.it.git metafy
  touch metafy/.rvmrc
  echo "rvm 1.9.2@metafy" > metafy/.rvmrc
  cd metafy
{% endhighlight %}

After this we'll install the gems. Note that curb also needs a version of libcurl-dev, could be named differently depending on version/dist. If you can build rvm + your ruby version of choice, then you should be fine with building the rest of the gems. Hence forth we'll be working from inside the metafy directory.

{% highlight bash %}
  gem install unicorn haml sinatra curb json rdiscount
{% endhighlight %}

Now it's time to install Nginx web server, if you'll use ubuntu simply do:

{% highlight bash %}
  sudo apt-get install nginx
{% endhighlight %}

Edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf to look something like this:

{% highlight nginx %}
worker_processes  1;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    include mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    sendfile  on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    keepalive_timeout 5;
    gzip on;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;

    upstream unicorn_server {
      server unix:/home/web/metafy/tmp/sockets/unicorn.sock
      fail_timeout=0;
    }

    server {
      server_name YOUR-HOSTNAME.com;
      root /home/web/metafy/public;
      listen 80;
      keepalive_timeout 5;

      location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;
        if (!-f $request_filename) {
          proxy_pass http://unicorn_server;
          break;
        }
      }
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}

And then we'll fire up the site after we've created the directories necessary for unicorn:

{% highlight bash %}
  mkdir -p tmp/sockets tmp/pids log
  
  unicorn -c unicorn.rb -E production -l 127.0.0.1:5000 -D
  sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
{% endhighlight %}

The unicorn command says that we'll start unicorn by the rules in the config file unicorn.rb, sets environment to production, and binds the application to localhost with the port 5000, and then finally daemonizes the whole thing.

To stop unicorn you'll need to find and kill the processes. "ps aux | grep unicorn", "kill -9 pid1 pid2 pid3".

Notice here that we'll start unicorn as a regular user and Nginx as sudo, we don't want to start unicorn as sudo, but this can be done with "rvmsudo unicorn..." if it's really necessary. Let's try to run as much as possible in the user space instead of the system space. Also, note that all paths points at /home/web/metafy, you'll need to update the config paths if you put it somewhere else.

You'll might also need to allow Nginx to talk to unicorn in your firewall, this can be done by a rule like this(if you use iptables): "-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5000 -s localhost -j ACCEPT". Depending on port of course.

This should leave you with your own complete running version of the Metafy.it web application.
